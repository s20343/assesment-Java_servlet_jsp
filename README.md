Server-Side and Client-Side Validation:

The application performs server-side validation to check for valid positive numbers.
Additionally, it uses client-side validation to ensure users input only numbers.

Enter a positive number in the input field and click "Calculate."
The application will display a list of prime numbers up to the entered value.
If the input is invalid, an error message will be shown.
